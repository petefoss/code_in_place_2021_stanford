  Pairs Memory Game 2021
  <br>
</h1>

<h4 align="center">This is my final project for Stanford University's Code In Place 2021. It is a Memory Card Game written in Python. It uses the tkinter library to generate a GUI. Keyboard events and mouse clicks are used to make it a more engaging and interactive experience.</h4>

## Key Features

* The following libraries are used
  - tkinter
  - PIL
  - random
  - time
* A tkinter canvas is created
* 4 random pairs of animal images are selected
* The game is to match the pairs by clicking the cards
* Random 'well done' messages are displayed when a match is correct
* Random 'bad luck' messages are displayed when a match is incorrect
* The games are timed so you can see how well you did
* There is a hidden easter egg - When you press the letter 'c' on the keyboard it sets all the animals to lions
* Watch the [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IahznK-ZSKU&t=135s "link to youtube video of project") to see it working 

## Code In Place

[Code in Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/ "link to code in place website") has been hosted twice (as of 2023), once in 2020 and once in 2021. It was an inspiring experience. Tens of thousands of students were introduced to the wonderful world of programming in python. Many new teachers had their first experience in front of students. Friendships were made across countries.

It was perhaps the single course with the largest number of teachers ever. Across two offerings there were over:

- 2,100 section leaders teach
- 22,000 students
- 1:10 student to section leader ratio
- 1/2 of Stanford's CS106A

Students and section leaders came from around the world, and represented a broad distribution of backgrounds.


## To Do

Potential features
* rewrite with kivy to allow android and ios apps
* extend easter egg to allow a hero mode, where every pair is always right
* have different sizes of game that can selected for different difficulties
